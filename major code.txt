    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}[H]

Figure 4.1 is a diagram of a system, in which the principal parts or functions are
represented by blocks connected by lines that show the relationships of the blocks.
The block diagram is typically used for a higher level, less detailed description aimed
more at understanding the overall concepts and less at understanding the details of
implementation.

\section{Design Phase }
\subsection{Data Flow Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height= 10cm, width=15cm]{Data.png}
\caption{\textbf{Data Flow Diagram}}
\end{figure}

The DFD is also called as bubble chart.As shown in the Figure 4.2 It is a
simple graphical formalism that can be used to represent a system in terms of input
data to the system, various processing carried out on this data, and the output data is
generated by this system. The data flow diagram (DFD) is one of the most important
modeling tools. It is used to model the system components. These components are
the system process, the data used by the process, an external entity that interacts with
the system and the information flows in the system. DFD shows how the information
moves through the system and how it is modified by a series of transformations. It
is a graphical technique that depicts information flow and the transformations that
are applied as data moves from input to output.DFD is also known as bubble chart.
A DFD may be used to represent a system at any level of abstraction. DFD may
be partitioned into levels that represent increasing information flow and functional
details.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[height= 10cm, width=12cm]{usecase.png}
\caption{\textbf{Use Case Diagram}}

\end{figure}
Description
Figure 4.3 is a use case diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is
a type of behavioral diagram defined by and created from a Use-case analysis. Its
purpose is to present a graphical overview of the functionality provided by a sys tem in terms of actors, their goals (represented as use cases), and any dependencies
between those use cases. The main purpose of a use case diagram is to show what
system functions are performed for which actor. Roles of the actors in the system
can be depicted.
\subsection{Class Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height= 10cm, width=12cm]{class.png}
\caption{\textbf{Class Diagram}}
\end{figure}
Description
n software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language
(UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system
by showing the system’s classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the
relationships among the classes. It explains which class contains information.Class
diagrams are the blueprints of your system or subsystem. You can use class diagrams
to model the objects that make up the system, to display the relationships between
the objects, and to describe what those objects do and the services that they provide.
Class diagrams are useful in many stages of system design as shown in the figure
4.4.

\subsection{Sequence Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height= 12cm, width=12cm]{seque.png}
\caption{\textbf{Sequence Diagram}}
\end{figure}
Description
Figure 4.5 Represent the objects participating the interaction horizontally and
time vertically. A Use Case is a kind of behavioral classifier that represents a dec laration of an offered behavior. Each use case specifies some behavior, possibly
including variants that the subject can perform in collaboration with one or more
actors. Use cases define the offered behavior of the subject without reference to its
internal structure. These behaviors, involving interactions between the actor and the
subject, may result in changes to the state of the subject and communications with
its environment. A use case can include possible variations of its basic behavior,
including exceptional behavior and error handling.

\subsection{Unit testing}
\subsubsection{}
Identify Units to Test: Break down your code into smaller units or components that can be tested independently. For example, you might have units for sensor reading, data processing, communication with the cloud, UI components, etc.

*Write Test Cases: Develop test cases for each unit to verify its functionality. Test cases should cover both normal and edge cases to ensure robustness. For the battery monitoring system, you might have test cases to simulate different battery levels, network connectivity scenarios, error handling, etc.

*Setup Testing Environment: Set up a testing environment where you can run your unit tests. This might involve creating mock objects or simulators for hardware components such as sensors or the ESP8266.

*Select a Testing Framework: Choose a testing framework suitable for your platform. For ESP8266 code, you might use the Arduino Unit Testing framework or another testing library compatible with the Arduino IDE. For Android, you can use JUnit for unit testing Java code and Espresso for UI testing.

*Identify Integration Points: Determine the points in your system where different components interact with each other. In your case, this might include communication between the ESP8266 device and the Android IoT cloud, as well as interactions between the Android app and the cloud.

*Define Test Scenarios: Develop test scenarios that cover various aspects of the system's interaction. This could include scenarios such as:
*Sending battery data from ESP8266 to the IoT cloud.
*Retrieving battery status from the cloud to the Android app.
*Handling communication errors or timeouts gracefully.
*Testing different network conditions (e.g., Wi-Fi connectivity issues).
*Prepare Test Environment: Set up a test environment that closely resembles the actual deployment environment of your system. This may involve configuring virtual devices or using hardware simulators to mimic the behavior of the ESP8266 device and the IoT cloud.

Write Test Cases: Create test cases to verify the behavior of the system under different integration scenario

\linespread{1.5}
\section{Efficiency of the Proposed System}
{Sample attached}\\
{ SHOULD BE MINIMUM TWO PARAGRAPHS -WITH MINIMUM 150 WORDS}

The proposed system is based on the Random forest Algorithm that creates many
decision trees. Accuracy of proposed system is done by using random forest gives
the ouput approximately 76 to 78 percent. Random forest implements many decision
trees and also gives the most accurate output when compared to the decision tree.
Random Forest algorithm is used in the two phases. Firstly, the RF algorithm extracts
subsamples from the original samples by using the bootstrap resampling method and
creates the decision trees for each testing sample and then the algorithm classifies
the decision trees and implements a vote with the help of the largest vote of the
classification as a final result of the classification. The random Forest algorithm
always includes some of the steps as follows:
Selecting the training dataset:Using the bootstrap random sampling method we
can derive the K training sets from the original dataset properties using the size of
all training set the same as that of original training dataset.
Building the random forest algorithm: Creating a classification regression tree
each of the bootstrap training set will generate the K decision trees to form a random
forest model, uses the trees that are not pruned. Looking at the growth of the tree,
31
this approach is not chosen the best feature as the internal nodes for the branches
but rather the branching process is a random selection of all the trees gives the best
features.

\section{Comparison of Existing and Proposed System}
{Sample attached}\\

\textbf{Existing system:(Decision tree)}\\ In the Existing system, we implemented a decision tree
algorithm that predicts whether to grant the loan or not. When using a
decision tree model, it gives the training dataset the accuracy keeps improving with
splits. We can easily overfit the dataset and doesn’t know when it crossed the line
unless we are using the cross validation. The advantages of the decision tree are
model is very easy to interpret we can know that the variables and the value of the

variable is used to split the data. But the accuracy of decision tree in existing system
gives less accurate output that is less when compared to proposed system.\\
\textbf{Proposed system:(Random forest algorithm)}\\ Random forest algorithm generates more
trees when compared to the decision tree and other algorithms. We can
specify the number of trees we want in the forest and also we also can specify maximum of features
to be used in the each of the tree. But, we cannot control the
randomness of the forest in which the feature is a part of the algorithm. Accuracy
keeps increasing as we increase the number of trees but it becomes static at one
certain point. Unlike the decision tree it won’t create more biased and decreases
variance. Proposed system is implemented using the Random forest algorithm so
that the accuracy is more when compared to the existing system.
